*Baptisias australis* is an herbaceous perennial plant in the bean family that can grow from 3 to 5 feet tall with showy blue flowers. It prefers full sun but will tolerate shade, however, it will droop and long stems with a few leaves at the terminal end. Indigo blooms from late spring to early summer. Sowing the seeds once they mature will allow this plant to spread otherwise it will slowly spread via rhizomes. If one does not intend to let it spread, the seed pods can be used in decorative flower arrangements. Deer find this plant to be unpalatable, it is also resistant to rabbits, and is not susceptible to pests or disease. Indigo is especially attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. In fact it is a larval host to many butterfly species, including; Orange sulfur, Clouded sulfur, Wild indigo duskywing, among others. In 1992, it was selected by the North Carolina Botanical Garden as the North Carolina Wildflower of the Year. In 2010, it was named the Perennial Plant of the Year by the Royal Horticulture Society.

*Eryngium yuccifolium* is a perennial forb growing from a crom-like crown with long, narrow, fibrous leaves with parallel venation that are organized in a rosette. This presentation of leaves is reminiscent of the yucca plant, thus the name, yuccifolium, meaning yucca-like leaves. Despite appearances, this plant is a member of the carrot family, evident by the aroma that is released when the leaves get damaged. The aroma of Rattlesnake master is because it shares many compounds and other secondary compounds found in carrots, parsley and parsnips. Depending on latitude, this plant blooms from May to August displaying greenish-white florets mingled with pointed bracts and clustered in globular heads. Monarch butterflies, skippers, and other butterflies visit this plant for nectar, while soldier beetles visit to eat the pollen. When pollinated this plant can be an aggressive self-seeder, however seedlings rarely flower before their third year. [@eryn; @eryn2]

*Rosa multiflora* is a non-native, invasive species of rose that was introduced to North America from eastern Asia. In the 1930s, it was planted throughout the US under the encouragement of the USDA Soil Conservation Service as a means of erosion control, wildlife habitat, and as a natural barrier to farm animals. By the 1960s, conservationists warned of the dangers of unmanaged multiflora rose, but it continued to be used as a food source for birds, as cover for wildlife, and in highway medians.
This invasive species is a climbing shrub that can grow 10 to 15 feet. The leaves are alternate and composed of 5 to 11 compound leaflets with serrate margins and a pointed-ovate shape. This invasive rose is distinguishable from the native swamp rose due to their white colored flowers vs. the native pink flowers. It is more readily distinguishable by looking at eh stipules of either plant; the invasive will be feathered where the leaves branch, while the native will have smooth stipules (see Figure 15 or 17).

Author's note on invasive species...
Invasive plants are detrimental to an area due to their ability to spread rapidly thereby crowding out other plants and potentially becoming a monoculture plot. Qualities that make invasive species so successful include; higher seed production that can remain viable for several years in the seed bank and many are monoecious (meaning male and female reproductive organs) allowing asexual reproduction. Invasive plants are readily able to re-sprout from cut or damaged stems. Another quality that proves detrimental involves their leaves and fruits, both of which bloom earlier and for a longer period than native plants. In the case of multiflora rose, this invasive shrub produces dense thorny thickets that deter predators further allowing it to grow and spread. [@multi; @multi2]

This member of the Aster family blooms from July to September with yellow disk flowers each with 8 to 13 ray florets. Rosinweed usually grows to a height of 6 feet with narrowly ovate, almost sessile (short petiole) leaves in whorls of three or sometimes oppositely arranged. [@silp; @silp2]

*Solidago altissima* is an herbaceous perennial wildflower native to and widespread across Canada, US, and northern Mexico. It has become naturalized to many parts of the world due to its tolerance to human disturbed habitats. The stems are rough and erect, growing between 2 and 4 feet tall, either singularly or in clusters. The leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate in shape with pentate or sometimes smooth margins. Late goldenrod is a late blooming flower that produces large conical array of as many as 1500 yellow flowers. This plant produces cysteine and serine protease inhibitors that affect the digestive system of herbivores and slows their growth and reproduction. This plant can also produce allelopathic compounds that inhibit the growth of neighboring plants, potentially making it weedy. *Solidago altissima* is the larval host of the Wavy-lined emerald moth and also supports various specialized bees, butterflies, and flower beetles.

*Trifolium pratense* is an herbaceous, short-lived perennial in the Bean family that is native to Europe, western Asia, and Northwest Africa, but naturalized to many other parts of the world. Clover is good for both improving soil structure due to its deep taproot and improving soil fertility because of its nitrogen-fixing properties. The leaves and flowers are both edible either cooked or raw. It can be used as a garnish, ground into a flour to make jellies and tissanes, or as an alternative medicine. While red clover is considered invasive, its overall benefits - early blooms for pollinators, nitrogen-fixation, and soil structure improvement - outweigh the competetive effect on non-native turf grasses.
